# Palantir-Foundry-Logistics-Project
This Palantir Foundry project automates a logistics pipeline using the Medallion Architecture. It uses PySpark to clean raw sales data and calculate real-time stock levels. By promoting this data to the Foundry Ontology, it creates a "Digital Twin" for reliable operational use and decision-making.
